Remake of the classic PacMan game, adapted for educational purposes, useful for showing the basic features of JavaScript, such as variables and constants, conditional and iterative structures, ternary operators, arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, eventListener and playing sounds.

Pacman moves one cell when pressing the arrow keys. To win you have to collect all the white dots, while if he crashes into the block you lose.

I share the code both for my students to study the code and for other teachers looking for ideas for their lessons.

Future development ideas:
- implement multiple levels;
- continuous movement of pacman;
- counter of white dots collected;
- calculation of game time starting from the first interaction with the page, currently there is a console.time();
- insertion of at least one ghost to hunt down pacman, in this case you can remove the collision management with the block that results in the game loss;
